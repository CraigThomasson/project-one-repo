## UX

## Strategy
<br>

## Goals
The goal was to create a site that will increase the online presence of the audiobook narrator, and increase the amount of potential work they are offered. The site needs to clearly state what service is offered, with a clear example of the quality of the product. 
At the same time, it should make it quick and easy to contact the narrator and request work.

##### To achieve these goals I will need to:
* Create a website with good searchability
* Have playable examples of work that is easy to access
* Ensure the contacts section is clear and easy to find
* Create a UX design that is intuitive to use and flows well
* The users will:
    * Be looking to hire an audiobook narrator:
    * Be able to quickly navigate to sample work and the contact section
    * Have a clear understanding of the services offered.

## Functionality:

## Load screen/about section

<img src="documentation/load-screen.PNG" width="450" height="250" alt="image of live site title acreen/about section">

The user can see what services are offered by the narrator in the about section and can see clear navigation options to the samples section and the contact section. There is also a call to action at the end of the about section so the user can pe directed to the contact page. This will make is easer for first time users navigate the page. The call to action will also help returning user that may be comparing narrators to quickly navigate to the contact page.
* The title and subtitle make it clear that the site is for audio book narration and the about section clearly stats the services offered.
* There is a nave bar that will send the user to each section of the page.
* I decided to turn this site in to a one-page site part way through he projects as this will mean that every thing the user need is easy to access. 
* I used a call to action that link to the contact section so that user that want to hire the narrator can quickly navigated to that section of the sight

## sample section

The samples in this section are easy for the user to find and of brief descriptions to give the user some context.
 * This section contains two audio players with samples of the narrators work. 
 * The samples section is the reason I chose to change to a one page style website as it made more sense to have the samples easily accessible to the user. 
* The audio players do not auto play when the site loads and can be controlled by the user. 
* This section also contains and image of the audio equipment a narrator would use. 

## Contact section
